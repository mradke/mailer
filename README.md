# What is Mailer?

Fork of clojurewerkz/mailer. Uses yogthos/Selmer templates instead of davidsantiago/stencil (if you need templates with logic)

## Project Goals

- Be a drop in replacement for clojurewerkz/mailer, when you need more complex templates.
- Don't be installable directly via leiningen (yet)
